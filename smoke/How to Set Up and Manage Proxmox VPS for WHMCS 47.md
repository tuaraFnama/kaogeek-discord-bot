In this article, we will show you how to set up and manage Proxmox VPS for WHMCS 47 in a few easy steps.
  
## Step 1: Install and Configure Proxmox VE
 
Before you can use Proxmox VPS for WHMCS 47, you need to have a Proxmox VE server up and running. Proxmox VE is a free and open-source platform that combines three virtualization technologies: KVM for full virtualization of Windows and Linux images, LXC for container-based virtualization of Linux applications, and OpenVZ for lightweight virtualization of Linux operating systems.
 
To install Proxmox VE, you need a dedicated server or a virtual machine with at least one public IP address, 8 GB of RAM, and 100 GB of disk space. You can follow the official installation guide[^1^] to download the ISO image and create a bootable USB stick or CD-ROM. Then, boot your server from the installation media and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
 
After installing Proxmox VE, you need to configure some basic settings such as network, storage, firewall, and cluster. You can use the web-based interface or the command-line interface to access the Proxmox VE management console. For more details on how to configure Proxmox VE, you can refer to the official documentation[^2^].
  
## Step 2: Install and Activate Proxmox VPS for WHMCS 47
 
Once you have your Proxmox VE server ready, you need to install and activate Proxmox VPS for WHMCS 47 on your WHMCS system. Proxmox VPS for WHMCS 47 is a commercial module developed by ModulesGarden[^3^] that integrates Proxmox VE with WHMCS. You can purchase the module from the WHMCS Marketplace[^3^] for $249.95 per year.
 
To install Proxmox VPS for WHMCS 47, you need to download the module files from your ModulesGarden account and upload them to your WHMCS root directory. Then, you need to activate the module in your WHMCS admin area by going to Setup > Addon Modules > Proxmox VE VPS For WHMCS > Activate. You will also need to enter your license key and assign access permissions to your admin roles.
  
## Step 3: Create and Configure Proxmox VPS Products
 
After activating Proxmox VPS for WHMCS 47, you need to create and configure your Proxmox VPS products in your WHMCS admin area. You can do this by going to Setup > Products/Services > Products/Services > Create a New Product. You will need to choose a product type (Hosting Account), a product group, a product name, and a pricing model.
 
Then, you need to go to the Module Settings tab and select ProxmoxVE as the module name. You will also need to enter your Proxmox VE server details such as hostname, username, password, port number, node name, storage ID, IP pool ID, etc. You can also choose the virtualization type (KVM, OpenVZ, or LXC), the operating system template or ISO image, the default resources (CPU cores, RAM, disk space, etc.), and the backup settings.
 
You can also create product addons for additional resources such as IP addresses, bandwidth, backups, memory, swap, and CPU cores. You can do this by going to Setup > Products/Services > Configurable Options > Create a New Group. You will need to assign the group to your product and add options with pricing values.
