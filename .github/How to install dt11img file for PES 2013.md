If you want to create your own dt11.img file for PES 2013, you need to have some basic knowledge of audio editing and file conversion. You also need to have some tools, such as AFS Explorer, ADX Converter and Audacity. Here are the steps to create a dt11.img file:

1. Find the audio files that you want to use as the announcer's voice and commentary for PES 2013. You can use any audio files that are in wav or mp3 format, such as recordings of real announcers, voice actors or yourself. You can also edit existing audio files to suit your preferences.

3. Rename the ADX files according to the naming convention of PES 2013. The dt11.img file contains several ADX files that correspond to different types of commentary, such as goal, foul, substitution, etc. You need to rename your ADX files to match the original ones. You can find a list of the original ADX file names and their meanings here. For example, if you want to replace the goal commentary with your own, you need to rename your ADX file to goal\_000.adx.
4. Create a new dt11.img file using AFS Explorer. AFS Explorer is a program that can create and edit AFS files, which are archives that contain multiple files. The dt11.img file is an AFS file that contains all the ADX files for the announcer's voice and commentary. You can download AFS Explorer from here. To create a new dt11.img file, follow these steps:

    - Select AFS Version 2 and click OK.
    - Click Import > Import Folder and select the folder that contains your renamed ADX files.
    - Click File > Save As and save your new dt11.img file.
5. Install your new dt11.img file for PES 2013 using the same method as described above.

Note: Creating a dt11.img file requires some trial and error and may not work perfectly for every audio file. You may need to adjust the volume, length and quality of your audio files to make them compatible with PES 2013. You may also need to test your new dt11.img file in-game to see if it works as expected.
